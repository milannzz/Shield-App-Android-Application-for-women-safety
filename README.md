**Core idea -**

Developing an Android Application for victim that will alert the Authorities & our network of 
users so that the help reaches to the victim ASAP. The App also records & saves the evidence 
to server to prevent a possible mishappening.

We are creating an Android App.

**1.SOS feature -->** Which broadcast the victim's live location with their profile details (photo,age) , so other users and nearest government authorities will go and help them as soon as possible.

**2.Domestic violence features -->** Upload proof (audio , video)  of domestic violence to server it help the victim's to get evidence.

**3.Trafficking feature -->** Report potential trafficking areas to the server which could be investigated by police.
